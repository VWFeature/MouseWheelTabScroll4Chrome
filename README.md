# MouseWheelTabScroll4Chrome
Daniel Gatti's script to allow tab scrolling by placing cursor on tab bar, and scrolling mouse wheel.
In Windows, I pin it to the taskbar and run it once after opening Chrome. It works flawlessly.  There is a comment on one of the chrome problem blogs about how great it is.  It used to be available on Google + which sadly is no more. I have NOT reviewed the code, though 2 years ago people said they had, and found no problems.  Use at your own risk.

I'm posting this as a public service because nothing else seems to work as well, and people have complained recently (Jan-June 2019) that Chrome suddenly scrolls tabs uncontrollably.  I have not had this problem; I do NOT know if mousewheeltabscroll4chrome is why. 

If Daniel wants to claim this project, I would welcome that.  As I recall, he had posted it as freeware.
